        HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP that uses encryption so that others cannot read information being sent between the server and client.
      </li>
      <li>
        An HTTP GET request asks for information from a server. An HTTP POST request sends information to a server. 
      </li>
      <li>
        2xx status codes mean that the client connected and pulled information from the server as expected. 4xx status codes mean that the client requested a resource from the servers that was not found.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ajax is a combination of several technologies, primarily Javascript, which allows a client to pull new information from a server without refreshing the page. It is useful whenever you want to request or send information from a page without navigating away from it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Responsive design is a way to format a web page so that it changes its' layout depending on the size of the screen and type of device the user is using.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first targets every < div > tag, the second targets the id of div, and the third targets everything with the class of div.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first loads an external javascript file. The second contains literal javascript within the tag.
      </li>
      <li>
        The first defines a function, while the second both defines and runs the function.
      </li>

        If the pixel is cached, it won't be loaded whenever someone loads the page, making it impossible to track more than once.
      </li>
      <li>
        There are several Meta tags, which work differently across different browsers. One way would be to include this tag in the head of the page hosting the image: < meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache"/ >
        (This answer was researched, credit goes to: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10314174/difference-between-pragma-and-cache-control-headers)

        Serving HTTP over HTTPS often causes errors. A solution could be to use a script tag instead of an img tag, or you could  remove the http, so that the src calls "//hashtag-analytics.com/12345/pixel.gif". The request should autofill with http or https depending on the website.
      </li>
      <li>
        The tracking company could grab any information about the client that is detectable from the HTTP GET request to their server, like the type of device, the IP address, the time it was viewed, and for how long.
      </li>
      <li>
        If javascript is sent, in theory anything within reason could be tracked. Whenever a user makes a keystroke you could have an ajax post to an outside server. If a user pauses a video on the page, you could send a timestamp of when it was paused. The only limits are really what kind of protection is on the browser and the skill of the person writing the javascript.
